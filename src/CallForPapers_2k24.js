                        "Film is 24 lies per second at the service of truth, or at the service of the
                        attempt to find the truth."<br></br>
                        Michael Haneke

					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Cinema exists within the narrative frame that the director or writer chooses. How closely that reflects
                    reality is entirely arbitrary. Yet it is undeniable that like all art, film plays a fundamental role in shaping
                    the way we think about politics, culture, identity, and social norms.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    The exploration of truth in cinema raises complex questions about the nature of storytelling and more
                    importantly, the ethical responsibilities of filmmakers. This raises the question of whether films should
                    always strive to tell the truth or if there is value in creative interpretations that challenge conventional
                    narratives. Dramatic irony, that dates back to <b>Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex</b>, illustrates how audiences can be
                    privy to more information than the characters inhabiting the action, hence the emergence of a difference in
                    perception of the narrative. This raises the question: can the distortion of truth enhance a film's emotional
                    impact and thematic depth? For instance, films like <b>The Matrix</b> challenge viewers to recognize that what
                    appears to be reality may actually be a constructed illusion, promoting questions about truth and
                    authenticity. On the other hand, films like <b>Triumph of the Will (1935)</b> employ grandiose visuals and
                    stirring speeches to create a glorified image of the Nazi regime. While it presents itself as a documentary,
                    the film selectively edits reality to promote an ideology.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    Now, documentary films and biopics of real-life historical figures are traditionally defined as non-fiction
                    cinematic works that aim to document reality, often with the purpose of educating audiences and
                    preserving historical records. While filmmakers have the right to artistic expression, they also bear the
                    responsibility to represent historical events accurately, particularly in docudramas that claim to be based
                    on true stories (Ashely Cope 2024). Documentary films as a genre occupy a unique space in the cinematic
                    landscape, often trying to straddle the line between fact and fiction, truth and interpretation. Using the
                    insignia of truth, implicit apparently in the very genre, the contrast between educating audiences and
                    edifying ideas is further an area to be explored (Jill Godmilow 1997). This raises questions about the
                    authenticity of the genre: How true should documentary films be to reality? Can distortions be justified in
                    such a form? Documentaries can be seen as a discourse of sobriety that aims to convey real events and truths, yet 
                    they inherently involve a degree of artistic interpretation and manipulation (Bill Nichols 1997).
                    So, what constitutes authenticity in genres such as documentary filmmaking?
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
                    As film criticism evolves, audiences are increasingly encouraged to scrutinise the underlying messages of
                    films, regardless of their artistic deftness. The creative liberty that can be excused by invoking cinematic
                    poetic licence is a complex issue. Filmmakers must consider whether lying or distorting reality is
                    necessary for entertainment and escapism. Representation in cinema becomes a philosophical endeavour
                    as filmmakers balance objective documentation with subjective interpretation, and the influence of this
                    representation on personal and collective experiences is significant. All this ultimately leads us to seek the
                    answer to this one question: In the face of such complexity, how do we navigate the labyrinth of truth and
                    fiction to finally be “liberated” in our understanding of cinema?
