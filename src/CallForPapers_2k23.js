					3rd EDITION THEME: CINEMA IN CRISIS
				</h2>
				<Grid container xs={12} className={`${styles.container} ${styles.column}`}>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						Crisis is defined as “a time of intense difficulty or danger.” As participants of a late-stage
						capitalist society, for many of us life <i>is</i> crisis. The crisis we face is that of change.
						Change is the constant state of being. One manifestation of this constant state of change is the
						terrain of technology. When we think of technology, we usually think of faster computers, smaller
						phones and the progressively intuitive interface of digital devices. As technology runs far ahead
						with a linear and often rapid erratic change, the definition of what ‘cinema’ means today lags behind.
						However, how do we really define cinema? Cinema is more than just art– it is a veritably gargantuan
						industry regulated by forces both within and without. In the current post-capitalistic scenario, with
						COVID-19 and its impacts reverberating with a formidable, palpable energy, what is generated is a
						distinct ethos. What emerges is a social impetus to a distinct pattern of production and consumption of
						cinema, transforming the meaning of ‘cinema’ itself.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						Then, what does ‘cinema’ mean today? The consumption of cinema can be neatly tied with the Latin roots
						of the word ‘addict’, which means ‘devotion,’ in a religious sense. The ritualistic consumption of
						entertainment in the form of ‘binge-worthy’ series, true crime documentaries, cross-cultural and
						cross-lingual cinema, celebrity memoir, etc. intersects with the prolific production of the same.
						Raymond Williams similarly observed the advent of television technology, that with the television
						signal coming into existence, there was a need to produce, to keep producing so as to keep transmitting
						through that signal. This need is a consumerist instinct we can see lucidly today, where to be entertained
						has become a legitimate right. This growing consumerist instinct in humanity is fed into by a circularity
						of novel changes in technology, which drive and are driven by the changing subjectivity.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						A technologically transforming cinema-scape is also a space for experimentation and resistance. This is a
						cinema which some have termed as non-cinema, a form which disregards and reformulates the traditional ways
						of visual storytelling. Jafar Panahi’s <i>This Is Not a Film</i> is, if the title isn’t obvious, a non-film. There
						is also a marked proliferation of genres such as slow cinema, which is a non-narrative, sensorial form of
						storytelling. The peripheral human experience is being documented in ways which had not been before with
						themes such as gender, caste, race, class intersecting and forming a complex intersection. There is a steep
						rise of independent productions, and all this has delimited the conventional imagery of a big screen cinema.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						What, then, does cinema stand for? How do we define cinema when patterns of cognition are being shaped
						simultaneously by technology and economics? Is the cinema of today driven by an obsessive need, not to tell
						stories, but to just produce? Or does this democratization of cinema grant agency to those who have always
						been objects, and never the subjects, of representation? <b><i>Is ‘cinema’ in crisis?</i></b>
